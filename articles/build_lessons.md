# Lessons I learnt during the build, but wish I didn't need to
Your mileage may vary - some of this will probably be very obvious to others (I hope so!)

In no particular order:
- ALL the motor directions had to be swapped in the example config file from Voron Design. That's fine, but half of the z-axis motor are opposite directions, so getting them all inverted was not obvious
- Lubricate the rails prior to installation, seriously
- Set the z-axis rails just a little more above the bottom (spec'd as 3mm) otherwise fitting the belt covers is a real pain
- Obsess over a square frame. I assembled mine once reasonably well, then carried it to my only really flat surface, the stone kitchen bench, and resquared it all, then went through and rail by rail put locktite on all the screws as I reinstalled them.
