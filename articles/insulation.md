# Stats on insulation acrylic vs polycarbonate twinwall
For U-values, lower is better

# Twinwall polycarbonate sheet
- 8mm - U-value 3.3
- 10mm - U-value 2.9
- Ref: https://vicwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SUNLITE_En_Technical_Guide_61353_Web_1.pdf
- Melting point >260&deg;C, glass transition ~147&deg;C

# Perspex / acrylic
- 3mm - U-value 5.2
- 5mm - U-value 4.9
- Ref: https://www.allplastics.com.au/component/docman/doc_download/93-allplastics-perspex-datasheet-for-glazing-pdf?Itemid=
- Melting point ~160&deg;C, glass transition 90-105&deg;C

# Final choice...
- I went with the 8mm Polycarbonate Twinwall - affordable from a hardware store, easy to work with (cuts with a craft knife) and mount with these clips from [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/All_Printers/annex_dev-Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges)
- Even with the active heating, the outside of the Twinwall panels are cool while the perspex doors are warm/hot
- The higher melting point (and glass transition) of the polycarbonate makes it a safer bet to have a heater sitting beside it
