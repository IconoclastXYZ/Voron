# Converting to an Umbilicus rather than drag chains

## What is needed to change
- Swap to CanBUS
- Move x-endstop to toolhead
- Move y-endstop to A-motor mount
- Make end mounts for the umbilicus

## CanBUS options
- HUVUD
- BTT EBB - 36 & 42 versions

## Moving x-endstop
- Built-in mount point on the new Stealthburner design

## Moving y-endstop
- [No need to reprint the A-motor mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Minsekt/Rear_Umbilical/Y_Endstop_Relocation)
- [Alt - no need to reprint the A-motor mount](https://github.com/RepRapster/Voron2.4-Rear-Gantry-Y-Endstop-Mount) - also reduces the offset required
- [Reprint of A-motor mount required](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Y_Endstop_Relocation)

## Umbilicus mount for toolhead
- [Designed for Stealthburner](https://github.com/majarspeed/Misc-Voron/tree/main/StealthBurner%20Umbilical%20cover)

## Umbilicus mount for A-motor
- [No need to reprint the mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Minsekt/Rear_Umbilical)
