## Moving x-endstop
- Built-in mount point on the new Stealthburner design

## Moving y-endstop
- [No need to reprint the A-motor mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Minsekt/Rear_Umbilical/Y_Endstop_Relocation)
- [Alt - no need to reprint the A-motor mount](https://github.com/RepRapster/Voron2.4-Rear-Gantry-Y-Endstop-Mount) - also reduces the offset required
- [Reprint of A-motor mount required](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Y_Endstop_Relocation)
